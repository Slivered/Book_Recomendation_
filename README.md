# The Art of Storytelling: A Collision of Cinema and the Literary World
---

<h1>Introduction</h1>

This project is an evolution of a [previous work](https://github.com/Slivered/Proyecto_ETL) where i compared the top 1000 movies from imdb to their book counterparts, this time i expanded this project and decided to get as much information as posible for movies and books and analyse the data to make graphs, get some conclusions and aswell do a recomend system using some machine learning technics.

<h2>Why?</h2>

---

* I have always loved reading aswell as watching movies, so naturally i often compare movies and books together wondering whats better and what are the strengths and weaknesess of these two worlds.

* Aswell this is my final project in [Ironhack](https://www.ironhack.com/es/en/madrid?utm_campaign=MAD_Spain_Madrid_Global_Search_Brand_EN&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_content=search-brand&utm_term=ironhack&gad=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw6IiiBhAOEiwALNqnceab3m3h_XKvK9R8wBY9Fqe7wq2IQcXMBB4g97pWWAeFcBVMWjBJFhoCY_EQAvD_BwE) Data Analytics Bootcamp and i found it interesting to end the bootcamp with the same project as i started it, showcasing everything i have learned.

<h2>Objectives</h2>

* Get all of the data by myself without using any starting csv.

* Be able to compare movies and books and see clearly what has usually better rating.

* Create a recomendation system using data scraped by myself.

* Showcase everything i did in a streamlit.


<h2>Methodology</h2>

---

* Data recollection üîç

 I recollected the data using various Selenium functions to scrap Goodreads and imdbk, these functions receive a list of genres that you desire and the function will scrap these genres for you, after each genre the data will be save in a .pkl file.



* Data treatment and cleaning üßΩ

 I prepared various functions that will read a list of .pkl files transform them to DataFrames and clean them, then concat all of them together to have a single base DataFrame, then this DataFrame will go through various transformations.



* Analysis ü§ì

 I used various visualization tools make my graphs and aswell some functions to make interactive filters to analyse and explore the data more deeply.



* Modeling üñ•

 And to end this project i did a recomendator system using machine learning techniques to give a recomendation based on the user input---

* Streamlit üìö

Aswell i'll show my analysis, conclussions and model in a streamlit, it will be in spanish as im presenting this project to a spanish speaking audience but i'll make in the near future the same streamlit in english.


<h2>Thanks!!!!</h2>

I thank all of the Ironhack team but specially want to thank:
* [Ana](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ana-garcia-garcia-090a5058/) for being the best teacher ever and having so much patience with me and Lin.
* [Jean-Charles](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeancharlesyamada/) for the classes you taught us and help me get through this last project.
* [Cesar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cesar-valle-iturriaga/) for allways being there to answer any questions we had.

<h2>Tools:</h2>

* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language.
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/) is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python.
* [Pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) is used to store safely a list outside of your notebook, so if your kernel shuts down you won't lose any data.
* [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/) is a web scraping tool and it's great for automating your webscraping
* [Getpass](https://docs.python.org/3/library/getpass.html) is used to hide your mysql password.
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html) was used to make the graphs.
* [PandasProfiling](https://ydata-profiling.ydata.ai/docs/master/index.html) primary goal is to provide a one-line Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) experience in a consistent and fast solution. Like pandas df.describe() function, that is so handy, pandas-profiling delivers an extended analysis of a DataFrame while alllowing the data analysis to be exported in different formats such as html and json.
